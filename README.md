## Synopsis

This is a portfolio website, for helping people to learn about me and to contact me.

## Motivation

I am doing this project to set up a portfolio website.  My goal is to use semantically correct HTML, use as little JavaScript as possible, and to make this website Frameworkless [https://www.frameworklessmovement.org/].

## Installation

I will install this website on a VPS using a LEMP Stack without a control panel.

## API Reference

At this time an API will not be needed for this project.

## Tests

This project will be tested in different browsers and devices.  Various speed tests and load tests will also be conducted.  Additional tests include: broken link checker, accessibility test, structured data test, mobile friendliness test, W3C HTML and CSS tests.

## Contributors

This is a solo project and no other contributors will be needed for this project.

## License

This project is governed by no license.  This project is under copyright.  No one, other than myself, has a right to copy, modify, distribute, nor sublicense any part of this project.
